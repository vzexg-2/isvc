# About
ISVC stands for **Integrity System Verification Check**, it gather every single information in your device and analyze them.

it reads raw data from your phone like battery voltage, CPU temperature, and memory usage. Then it compares these numbers against what "engineers" consider normal ranges, the algorithm's assigns different importance levels to various measurements. Battery capacity matters more than temperature for overall battery health. Boot security features matter more than minor software issues for security scoring and then it combines all these individual assessments using weighted averages to create overall health scores

# Algorithms used

## Battery Health Algorithm  
### NAME : "Power Degradation Analysis (PDA)"  

This algorithm is based on a weighted multi-factor: 
- Capacity Ratio Analysis: Ratio of current to design capacity (50% weight)  
- Voltage Health Inspection: Comparison between the voltage standard is 4.2V (20% weight)  
- Thermal Penalty Calculation: Apply exponential penalties for temperatures >45C (15% weight)  
- Cycle Degradation Modeling: Models linear degradation model based on 1000 cycle life span (15% weight)  

The algorithm is able to "guess" scores because it is using established battery chemistry principles - lithium-ion batteries have predictable patterns of degradation based on these physical parameters ;)

## Security Verify Algorithm  
### Multi Vector Security Confidence (MVSC)  

Uses total confidence scoring:  
- Binary Detection (root binaries, system modifications)  
- Weighted confidence based on reliability of detection method  
- Cross verification between different detection vectors  
- File system integrity checking 

This is possible because of the traces security compromises leave in predictable places in the system.

## Performance Health Algorithm
### Dynamic System Load Assessment (DSLA)  

Uses real-time utilization analysis of resources:  
- Multicore CPU Utilization Over Time
- Memory Pressure Calculation with Buffer/cache analysis  
- Thermal envelope monitoring using zone specific weighting  
- Performance Monitoring: Testing I/O performance against an assumed benchmark performance

## General System Health Algorithm  
### Composite System Reliability Index (CSRI)  

This is the algorithm giving the combination of all the subsystem scores:  
- Weighted average for 7 major system components  
- Critical threshold detection using exponentially penalized curves  
- Reliability index calculation using the principles of availability theory  
- Predictive health modeling based on current trends analysis.
